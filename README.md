NPC Skin Converter is a utility I developed to convert LOTR Mod NPC skins from the old Legacy format (64x64) into the new Renewed format (128x64, incorporating features from the modern player skin format.)

Maybe you will find it useful too.

To run, 'mvn package' to get the .jar, then put it in the folder containing the skins you wish to convert, and run using 'java -jar [filename.jar] [skin-type]'

Skin types are man, elf, hobbit, dwarf, orc.
